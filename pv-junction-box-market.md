<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The PV Junction Box Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Potting PV Junction Box</li><li>Non-Potting PV Junction Box</li></ul></p>
<p><p>PV Junction boxes are an essential component in solar panel systems. The potting PV junction box is designed with a protective casing of resin to prevent moisture and dust ingress, ensuring long-term durability. On the other hand, non-potting PV junction boxes do not have this protective covering, making them more suitable for indoor applications where environmental conditions are controlled. Both types cater to different needs based on the installation environment and level of protection required for the solar panel system.</p></p>
