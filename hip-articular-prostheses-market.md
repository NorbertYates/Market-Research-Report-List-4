<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hip Articular Prostheses Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cemented</li><li>Non-Cemented Fixation</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Hip articular prostheses can be classified into two main types based on the method of fixation: cemented and non-cemented. Cemented fixation involves using bone cement to secure the prosthesis to the bone, providing immediate stability. Non-cemented fixation, on the other hand, relies on bone ingrowth or osseointegration for long-term stability. While cemented prostheses are simpler to implant, non-cemented prostheses are associated with fewer instances of loosening and may be more suitable for younger, more active patients.</p></p>
