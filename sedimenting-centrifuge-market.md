<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Sedimenting Centrifuge Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Low Speed Centrifuge</li><li>High Speed Centrifuge</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Sedimenting centrifuges are classified into two main types based on their rotational speed: low speed centrifuges and high speed centrifuges. Low speed centrifuges operate at lower speeds, typically under 10,000 revolutions per minute (RPM), and are suitable for applications that require gentle separation of large particles or cells. High-speed centrifuges, on the other hand, operate at speeds exceeding 10,000 RPM, offering faster and more efficient separation of smaller particles or molecules. These different types cater to a wide range of research and industrial applications.</p></p>
