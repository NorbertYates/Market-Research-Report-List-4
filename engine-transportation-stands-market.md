<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Engine Transportation Stands Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bootstrap Stand</li><li>Non-bootstrap Stand</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Engine transportation stands are essential tools used in aircraft maintenance for transporting engines from one place to another. There are two main types of engine transportation stands: bootstrap stands and non-bootstrap stands. Bootstrap stands have built-in hydraulic jacks that allows the engine to be lifted onto the stand without the need for additional equipment. Non-bootstrap stands, on the other hand, require external equipment such as cranes or forklifts to lift the engine onto the stand. Both types of stands serve the same purpose of safely and efficiently transporting engines during maintenance procedures.</p></p>
