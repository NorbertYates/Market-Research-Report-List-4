<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wafer CMP Pads Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hard CMP Pads</li><li>Soft CMP Pads</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Wafer CMP pads are essential components in the semiconductor manufacturing process, used for polishing and planarizing wafers. There are two main types of CMP pads: Hard CMP pads and Soft CMP pads. Hard CMP pads are typically made of a rigid material and provide high removal rates, making them ideal for aggressive polishing processes. Soft CMP pads, on the other hand, are made of a more compliant material, offering gentle polishing action and better control over the polishing process. Both types have their own advantages and are used in different applications based on specific requirements.</p></p>
