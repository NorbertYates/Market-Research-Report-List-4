<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cutting Loop Electrodes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Monopole</li><li>Twin Pole</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cutting loop electrodes are commonly divided into two types: monopole and twin pole. Monopole electrodes consist of a single active wire loop that delivers electrical current to the target tissue for cutting or coagulation. On the other hand, twin pole electrodes have two active wires that work simultaneously to provide more precise cutting and coagulation. Both types of electrodes are used in various medical procedures to remove tissue or control bleeding with the help of electrical current.</p></p>
