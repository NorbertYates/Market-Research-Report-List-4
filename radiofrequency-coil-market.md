<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Radiofrequency Coil Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Volume Coils</li><li>Surface Coils</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Radiofrequency coils are commonly used in MRI machines to transmit and receive radiofrequency signals for imaging purposes. There are two main types of RF coils used in MRI machines: volume coils and surface coils. Volume coils are larger and cover a larger area of the body, making them suitable for imaging larger anatomical regions. On the other hand, surface coils are smaller and designed to be placed closer to the body part of interest, providing higher resolution images of specific areas. Both volume and surface coils play a crucial role in obtaining quality images in MRI scans.</p></p>
