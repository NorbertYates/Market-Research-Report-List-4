<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Natural Gas Pipeline Transportation Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Gathering Pipelines</li><li>Transportation Pipelines</li><li>Distribution Pipelines</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Natural Gas Pipeline Transportation Market includes three main types: Gathering Pipelines, Transportation Pipelines, and Distribution Pipelines. Gathering pipelines collect natural gas from wells and transport it to processing plants. Transportation pipelines then move the processed gas across long distances to distribution centers or end-users. Distribution pipelines deliver the gas directly to homes, businesses, and other consumers. Each of these market types plays a crucial role in efficiently transporting natural gas from production sites to consumption areas.</p></p>
