<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Metal Scavenger Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Acidic Chemical Scavenger</li><li>Alkaline Chemical Scavenger</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Metal scavenger market can be categorized into two types based on the chemical properties used for metal removal: acidic chemical scavengers and alkaline chemical scavengers. Acidic chemical scavengers work by forming complexes with metal ions, making them insoluble and easily separated from the solution. On the other hand, alkaline chemical scavengers neutralize acidic metal contaminants by forming precipitates that can be filtered out. Both types of scavengers are essential in industries where metal removal is critical for product quality and environmental compliance.</p></p>
