<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Solar Lighting System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Off-grid</li><li>Hybrid</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Solar lighting systems can be divided into two main types: off-grid and hybrid systems. Off-grid systems are standalone units that operate independently from the grid, relying solely on solar power to generate electricity. These systems are ideal for remote areas with limited access to electricity. Hybrid systems, on the other hand, combine solar power with another power source such as wind or diesel generators. These systems are more reliable and can provide consistent power even in situations where sunlight is limited.</p></p>
