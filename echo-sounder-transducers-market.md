<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Echo Sounder Transducers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Split-beam Transducers</li><li>Single Beam Transducers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Echo sounder transducers are categorized into two main types: split-beam transducers and single beam transducers. Split-beam transducers emit multiple sonar beams in different directions, allowing for more precise underwater mapping and fish detection. On the other hand, single beam transducers emit a single sonar beam in a specific direction, making them ideal for simpler depth measurement tasks. Both types of transducers have their own unique applications and are commonly used in various industries such as marine navigation, hydrography, and fisheries.</p></p>
