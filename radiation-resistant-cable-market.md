<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Radiation Resistant Cable Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Core</li><li>Multi Core</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Radiation resistant cables can be classified into two main types: single core and multi-core cables. Single core cables consist of a single conductor surrounded by insulation and a protective sheath, making them suitable for applications where a high level of radiation resistance is required in a compact design. On the other hand, multi-core cables contain multiple conductors within a single jacket, allowing for the transmission of multiple signals within a single cable while maintaining radiation resistance. Both types of cables are essential in industries such as nuclear power, aerospace, and medical imaging.</p></p>
