<p><strong>The Multifocal Toric Intraocular Lens IOLs Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Not Pre-loaded IOLs</li><li>Pre-loaded IOLs</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Multifocal Toric Intraocular Lens IOLs, also known as multiple-focus toric IOLs, are types of intraocular lenses used in cataract surgery to correct both cataracts and astigmatism. The two main market types for these lenses are pre-loaded IOLs and not pre-loaded IOLs. In pre-loaded IOLs, the lens is pre-inserted into the injector, making the surgery process more efficient. In not pre-loaded IOLs, the lens must be manually loaded into the injector before surgery, which may require more time and precision from the surgeon.</p></p>
