<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The 4G Base Station Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Macrocell</li><li>Small Cell</li></ul></p>
<p><p>4G base stations are deployed in two main market types - macrocell and small cell. Macrocells are larger base stations that cover a wider area and are typically used in urban and suburban areas to provide broader coverage and capacity. Small cells, on the other hand, are smaller base stations that are deployed in dense urban areas, indoor locations, and rural areas to enhance coverage and capacity in specific areas where macrocells may not be sufficient. Both macrocell and small cell markets play a key role in expanding and improving 4G network coverage and capacity.</p></p>
